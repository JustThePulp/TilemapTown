Tiles are defined with a JSON object, which can have the following fields:

"name"
	Friendly name for the tile. Not currently used for anything, but could be displayed in a client.

"pic":
	Graphic to use for the tile.
	Format is [sheet, x, y] where sheet may be an image URL directly, or it may be an ID that points to a tileset image indirectly.

"density":
	Defaults to false. If true, users will be stopped when attempting to walk onto this tile.

"obj":
	Defaults to false. If true, tile goes on the map's object layer instead of the turf layer.

"type":
	Tile type. Only "sign" does anything currently, in which case the user will see the "message" field when the tile is bumped into.
	Other tile types that are used in the default tileset (but not supported by the client) are "escalator" (automatically move in a given direction), "ice" (keep moving until you hit a non-ice tile).

"message":
	Message to display if user bumps into this tile and it's type is "sign".

"dir":
	Tile direction. Not used for anything currently. Directions available:
	0 = East
	1 = South east
	2 = South
	3 = South west
	4 = West
	5 = North west
	6 = North
	7 = North east

"over":
	Display over entities. Can currently only apply to map objects, not map tiles.
